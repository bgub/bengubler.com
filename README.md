Welcome to my personal website!

I built it using some fun tools like

- Next.js
- shadcn UI
- Giscus
- Tailwind
- Content Collections

etc.

I also added some neat features like

- Automatic dark mode
- Mobile-first design
- Accessibility support
- View transitions
- CSS container queries

Feel free to borrow + use my code, just credit me in a comment or something.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
