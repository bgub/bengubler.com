I decided to learn Nix on Saturday. After hours of work, I came up with this configuration. Shoutout to my friend [Ethan Niser](https://github.com/ethanniser) who gave me the idea and whose config I started out with.

Setting up a new Mac for development is painful. You install Homebrew, Node via nvm, Python via pyenv, configure your shell, install GUI apps individually, and hope you remember everything when switching machines.

Nix makes your entire system configuration declarative and reproducible, but most configurations online are too complex for beginners or assume Linux knowledge.

[nix-macos-starter](https://github.com/nebrelbug/nix-macos-starter) is a beginner-friendly Nix configuration that includes development tools (mise for runtime management, CLI tools, formatters), GUI applications via Homebrew, and system configuration with sensible defaults.

Replace a few placeholders, run one command, and you have a fully configured development environment.

## Installation

1. **Install Nix** using the [Determinate Systems installer](https://docs.determinate.systems/#products). Download the graphical installer for macOS and restart your terminal after installation.

2. **Install Homebrew** from [brew.sh](https://brew.sh) for GUI applications.

3. **Clone and configure**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nebrelbug/nix-macos-starter ~/.config/nix
   cd ~/.config/nix
   ```

4. **For Intel Macs**: Change `"aarch64-darwin"` to `"x86_64-darwin"` in `flake.nix` line 28.

5. **Replace placeholders** in these files:

   - `modules/git.nix`: `YOUR_NAME`, `YOUR_EMAIL`, `YOUR_USERNAME`
   - `modules/home-manager.nix`: `YOUR_USERNAME`
   - `platforms/darwin.nix`: `YOUR_USERNAME` (appears 3 times)
   - `hosts/my-macbook/configuration.nix`: `YOUR_USERNAME`

6. **Build and switch**:
   ```bash
   darwin-rebuild switch --flake .#my-macbook
   ```

After initial setup, use the `nix-switch` alias to rebuild your configuration.

## Customization

- **Add CLI tools**: Edit the `packages` array in `modules/home-manager.nix`
- **Add GUI apps**: Edit the `casks` array in `modules/homebrew-common.nix`
- **Add development tools**: Add `${pkgs.mise}/bin/mise use --global tool@version` to the activation script in `modules/home-manager.nix`
- **Host-specific config**: Use `hosts/my-macbook/configuration.nix` for machine-specific packages and settings
