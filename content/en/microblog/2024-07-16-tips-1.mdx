- You can turn on Markdown detection in Google Docs! Just go to `Tools > Preferences > Automatically detect Markdown`
- Brave Browser for iOS supports swiping left and right between between tabs â€” you just have to swipe _below_ the URL bar.
- If you need to run a `.ts` file from the command-line, use Bun instead of ts-node! It's much simpler and doesn't have all the weird issues with the package.json `"type"` field.
