          I study machine learning and (human) languages. In my free time, I
          like to build websites and open-source libraries. I'll probably post
          about all of the above from time to time.

          I'm currently a student at Brigham Young University in Provo, where
          I'm pursuing a major in ACME (Applied and Computational Mathematics)
          and a minor in Arabic. I'm also a research assistant in the PCCL
          (Perception, Control, and Cognition Lab) at BYU, where I study novel
          applications of artificial intelligence and Natural Language
          Processing.
