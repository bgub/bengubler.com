        I study machine learning and (human) languages. In my free time, I like
        to build websites and open-source libraries. I'll probably post about
        all of the above from time to time.

        I'm currently a student at Brigham Young University in Provo, where I'm
        pursuing a major in ACME (Applied and Computational Mathematics) and a
        minor in Arabic. I'm also a research assistant in the PCCL (Perception,
        Control, and Cognition Lab) at BYU, where I study novel applications of
        artificial intelligence and Natural Language Processing.
